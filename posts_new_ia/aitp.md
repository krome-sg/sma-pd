# Accelerated Industry-centric Training Pathway (AITP) - Media Sector

## Overview

Complete your accreditation as an Adult Educator (AE) for the media industry in 40 hours. This Accelerated Industry-centric Training Pathway (AITP) is a specially curated programme with the Institute for Adult Learning (IAL), and recognised by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) for purposes of meeting SSG Adult Educator (AE) requirements for the Media Sector. This programme is designed by IAL to uphold the highest standards in adult learning design and delivery. Singapore Media Academy is the Appointed Industry Partner (AIP) to deliver this programme that is contextualised specifically for the Media sector. It serves to accredit trainers, enabling them to deliver SSG-funded Training and Adult Education (TAE) courses within the Media domain. Unlike the generic WSQ ACLP qualification, the AITP is industry specific— accrediting learners to teach/facilitate only within their respective domain of contextualisation. This intensive programme spans 40 hours over 5 days and equips participants with the knowledge and competencies needed to deliver domain-relevant WSQ courses effectively.
