# * Promote Products and Services on Social Media

## Overview

The growing internet age and social media phenomenon have changed how people receive, process, and understand information. With the overwhelming barrage of things to notice and to keep track of, consumers have shorter attention spans, and they tend to choose and filter the news and information they want to receive. This course offers participants knowledge in the fundamentals of social media, where they will learn how to leverage social media to meet business objectives. Apart from gaining a comprehensive overview of social media, the course also teaches participants ways of crafting a viable and effective social media strategy plan. Some of the focus areas include content creation, management and distribution, measuring returns and ROI, and how to avoid having these new tools work against them. Social media is a tool, not a destination, and companies can use social media to maximise visibility and presence online by engaging their customers.
