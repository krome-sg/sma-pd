# * Manage IP at a Strategic Level

## Overview

Intellectual property protection is critical to fostering innovation. Without the protection of ideas, businesses and individuals would not reap the full benefits of their inventions and would focus less on research and development. This is particularly important in the media industry as creative ideas and artists need to be protected against not getting full compensation for their creations, which would lead to the suffering of their cultural vitality. This course teaches participants how to manage intellectual property (IP) at a strategic level. It covers education on the basic definitions of IP-related terms and identifies key IP assets that align with business strategies. The unit also includes understanding appropriate legal measures to protect IP where applicable and appropriate, incorporating IP into business strategies, and defining internal policies and processes to manage IP.
## Learning Outcomes
