## Overview

This module provides an in-depth exploration of the processes involved in guiding creative leads and cast throughout the production journey to achieve the overall creative vision. It covers essential aspects of creative storytelling, including both linear and nonlinear narratives, and emphasises the importance of understanding target audiences. Participants will learn about the principles of content development, cinematography, and the aesthetics of framing and camera movement. The curriculum also addresses practical considerations such as production budgets, timelines, workflows, and the roles and responsibilities within production teams. Key topics include interpreting scripts, conceptualising visual representation through lighting, sound, special effects, style, and set design. The module will delve into directing rehearsals, providing feedback, guiding camera and lighting operations, and overseeing post-production processes such as video and sound editing.
