+ Terms and Conditions

1. Definitions
1.1. In this General Terms and Conditions, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms and expressions shall have the following meanings:
“Course” means the relevant course as set out in each Course Information Sheet which the Trainee is applying to participate in.
“Course Fee” means the amount of course fee set out in applicable Course Information Sheet.
“Course Information Schedule” means the course information sheet or record issued by SMA from time to time setting out the particulars and terms and conditions relating to each Course provided by SMA and/or any other third party.
“Parties” means SMA and the Trainee, and “Party” means any of them.
“SMA” means Singapore Media Academy Private Limited, and its permitted assigns.
“Special Conditions” means any special condition(s) set out in the relevant Course Information Sheet.
“Trainee” means the individual who has applied to participate in a Course.
“SSG” means the SkillsFuture Singapore.
“WSQ” or the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications, is a national credentialing system that trains, develops, assesses and recognises adult workers for competencies they need to stay employable. Based on standards developed by SSG and various industries, WSQ ensures workers acquire skills needed by employers at the workplace. With clear progression pathways, workers can also use WSQ to upgrade their skills and plan their careers. As training and assessment are competency-based, not academic-based, workers have to demonstrate the right competencies before they are certified. Experienced workers however, can receive WSQ certification without training. WSQ is accessible to all workers, as its entry criteria are skills and knowledge, not formal qualifications. The quality of WSQ is assured by SSG, from the development of competency standards, accreditation of training providers to the award of its qualifications.
