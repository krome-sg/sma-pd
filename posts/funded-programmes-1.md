+ WSQ FRAMEWORK
Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) is a national credential system that trains, develops, assesses and certifies skills and competencies for the workforce.

WSQ-accredited courses take reference from the skills developed under the Skills Frameworks. The Skills Framework provides key information on the job roles and skills that an individual needs to perform various job tasks and to stay transferable.

WSQ is underpinned by a strong quality assurance framework. From developing Technical Skills and Competencies and Critical Core Skills, to approving training providers and awarding WSQ qualifications, stringent criteria are applied to ensure the necessary standards and delivery. A structured and efficient system has been established to help build a strong training infrastructure that supports Singapore's workforce development.

The Singapore Media Academy (SMA) was appointed in 2008 as the Media Continuing Education and Training (CET) Centre for the media industry. Since its inception as Media CET Centre, the SMA has up-skilled and trained more than 1,500 media professionals and issued more than 2,000 WSQ Statements of Attainment1 (SOAs) in the areas of Broadcast Journalism, Film & TV Production and Directing, Cinematography, Camera, Sound and Lighting Operations, Editing, Sales & Media Marketing, Writing, and Strategy Planning.
1A Statement of Attainment is a WSQ Certification issued to a person for completing a WSQ course. Records of the SOAs can be accumulated towards a qualification under the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications System.Upcoming Courses
