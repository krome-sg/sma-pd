OVERVIEWThe growing internet age and social media phenomenon have changed how people receive, process, and understand information. With the overwhelming barrage of things to notice and to keep track of, consumers have shorter attention spans, and they tend to choose and filter the news and information they want to receive.This course offers participants knowledge in the fundamentals of social media, where they will learn how to leverage social media to meet business objectives. Apart from gaining a comprehensive overview of social media, the course also teaches participants ways of crafting a viable and effective social media strategy plan. Some of the focus areas include content creation, management and distribution, measuring returns and ROI, and how to avoid having these new tools work against them. Social media is a tool, not a destination, and companies can use social media to maximise visibility and presence online by engaging their customers.LEARNING OUTCOMESUnderstand social media and its rolesUnderstand the various platforms available and its characteristicsLearn what are the components of a social media planPlan a social media strategy detailing tactics that meet the needs and objectives of a marketing planDevelop test plans, both before and during the promotionContribute to the co-ordination of promotional activities in order to deliver the requirements of the marketing planMeasure, track and report on the social media tacticsEvaluate the social media strategy using relevant evaluation methodologyRecognise the importance of social media polices and the rules of engagementWHO SHOULD ATTENDMarketing & Branding Professional, Programming Manager, Business Manager, New Media Sales ProfessionalMODE OF TRAININGIn-Person and/or OnlineDURATION25 HoursDATECommencement Date: 3 November 2025For the course schedule, please email marketing@MediaAcademy.sgNote:This course will conclude with a compulsory assessment.
