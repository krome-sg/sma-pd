In 2008, SMA was appointed by SkillsFuture Singapore (previously known as Workforce Development Agency) as the sole Continuing Education and Training Centre for the Singapore Media Industry and plays a central role in training and up-skilling media practitioners. SMA currently provides enrichment, education, and performance arts training to kids, youths, and hobbyists to nurture their creative and artistic potentials; training in film, broadcast, media and digital for adult professionals; and media training solutions and consultancy services to corporations and organisations.

SMA is awarded 4-year EduTrust Certification by the Committee for Private Education. EduTrust is a quality assurance scheme that recognises private education institutions for consistently maintaining high educational standards and services.
